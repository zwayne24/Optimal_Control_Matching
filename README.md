# Optimal_Control_Matching
This is the final deliverable for our MIT Capstone project in collaboration with TEA. We worked on a flexible script to evaluate treatment effects of observational studies. Since we don't have a random treatment population we built a matching algorithm to match similar treatment to control classes to derive the treatment effects.

In this repository you can find 2 files:

# Script.py:
This is the script to run the matching from the terminal. 

# Clean_functions.ipynb:
This file is a summary of all the functions used for the project.
