# Optimal_Control_Matching
This is the final deliverable for our MIT Capstone project in collaboration with TEA. We worked on a flexible script to evaluate treatment effects of observational studies. Since we don't have a random treatment population we built a matching algorithm to match similar treatment to control classes to derive the treatment effects.

In this repository you can find 2 files:

## Script.py:
This is the script to run the matching from the terminal. The script is flexible and generalizable and it can be used for many use cases. The following image shows the script flowchart with all the possible choices that the user can select for the matching.
